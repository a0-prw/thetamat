Thetamat is 'The Teaching Assistant for Mathematics'.  It is a system
of interactive lessons and exercises for teaching and demonstrating
elementary mathematics.  The lessons and exercises are made available
through a web-browser interface for use both in class teaching
situations by subscribed teachers and in individual practice and
lesson-review by their enrolled pupils.

The system guides pupils through the exercises, generating immediate
feedback for the pupil and progress reports which can be accessed by
the teacher.  The lessons provide both traditional text (containing
explicit instruction) and appropriate interactive elements which are
designed to support the understanding of the textual content.

Thetamat can supplement (and in some cases, depending on how the
teacher chooses to use it, replace) a traditional school textbook.
The program is not intended as a self-tutoring system, though more
mature, motivated students with good reading ability may be able to
use it in this way.

Thetamat may be particularly useful in teaching groups of pupils of
widely diverging levels of mathematical understanding, since it allows
pupils to progress at their own speed, while helping the teacher to
manage and monitor the pupils interaction with the teaching material.

The system is not intended to teach problem solving skills but aims to
assist in the teaching of basic skills and knowledge which are
prerequisite to developing mathematical problem-solving ability.

The system is currently roughly complete to about grade 5 or 6.

Background:

Thetamat was part of a commercial educational software system which I
was planning to market.  I ran out of time and money, and into some
issues in my personal life, which forced me to shelve my business
plans and find some work in the real world.  This accounts for some of
the weirdness in the code, since what you have here has been ripped
out of a larger system.  Other wierdnesses are probably the result of
unrefined design decisions coupled with a severe lack of time.  In
particular, I would change the crazy, insane topsort of the modules
which is way over the top.  I started a saner way of defining modules,
but did not have time to finish it. Look in Scripts/Lesson-texts for
how it was unfolding.

Requirements:

Thetamat has been developed and tested using SBCL on Linux, but it
should run anywhere with a Common Lisp, perhaps with some fiddling
with pathname stuff.  Only Firefox and Chrome(ium) browsers were
developed for, so it is unlikely that it will work properly with IE.
In addition, the current version of Firefox (25) suddenly stopped
registering keypress events, so if you use the scratchpad, you will
have to use the mouse and menu until Firefox magically starts working
again (I am not going to fix it).

Installing: 

1) place Thetamat in ~/quicklisp/local-projects/autotutor/
2) Change directory to ~/quicklisp/local-projects/autotutor/
3) run sbcl --load mkcore.lisp
4) run sbcl --core at.core --load initialize-system.lisp
5) Visit https://localhost:4040 and login as "a0_larry" with password "foo"
6) Experiment

Useage:

To setup new teachers do (in lisp in package "AT") 

(define-teacher "Firstname" "Surnames" NPUPILS), where NPUPILS is how
many pupils the teacher should be allowed to enroll.

To delete a teacher (for example, a0_larry) do (in lisp, in package
"AT")
(delete-teacher-locally "a0_larry")

You can run thetamat on a public server somewhere with appropriate
settings for the IP address, etc in Infrastructure/package.lisp
